This project simulates a smart washing machine interface using an STM32 Nucleo development board and the Mbed OS platform.
It features a fully functional control system with hardware inputs such as buttons, potentiometers, and a force-sensitive 
resistor to select washing modes (Normal, Permanent Press, Delicate), adjust water temperature, set custom wash durations,
and monitor load weight to prevent overloading. Outputs include LED indicators, a 7-segment display, and a 
PWM-controlled buzzer for user feedback. The interface uses state-based logic to guide users through power toggling, 
cycle selection, and active washing cycles, complete with real-time feedback on time remaining. The project demonstrates 
embedded systems principles including digital/analog I/O, PWM, timers, FSMs (Finite State Machines), debouncing, and 
real-time sensor integration.
